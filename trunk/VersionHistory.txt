Roadmap for next Release
----------------------------------------------

* Add examaple usage of NHibernate.Validator along with unit tests of capabilities

Pending on Trunk
----------------------------------------------

Breaking Changes:
* Upgraded to ASP.NET MVC Beta web project; respective modifications made to web.config and assembly dependencies
* Upgrade to Beta also included changes to Global.asax.cs and the inclusion of Default.aspx.cs

Modifications to <root>/bin:
* All dependencies needed for your own project are now included in the bin folder

Modifications to SharpArch:
* Inclusion of NHibernate.Validator.  Optional NHibernate.Validator config file may be passed to NHibernateSession.Init within Global.asax.cs
* Marked both DomainSignatureAttribute and DomainSignatureComparable as Serializable (thanks athmer!)
* Upgraded SharpArch.Web to depend on ASP.NET MVC Beta assemblies
* The Equals/GetHashCode has been split; Equals no longer uses the result of GetHashCode for the basis of equality checking.  The affected classes include SharpArch.Core/DomainSignatureComparable.cs and SharpArch.Core/PersistenceSupport/PersistentObject.cs.  Although the underlying mechanism for these methods were altered, it should introduce no breaking changes.
* The methods GetByProperties(IDictionary<string, object> 
propertyValuePairs) and GetUniqueByProperties have been added to IDao 
and GenericDao.  A unit test using this feature has been added to 
Northwind.Tests/Northwind.Data/CustomerDaoTests.cs

Modifications to Northwind sample:
* Modified Northwind.Core/Order.cs to show an example of overriding HasSameDomainObjectSignatureAs()
* Added a many-to-many example; specifically:
  - Northwind.Core
    * Employee has a many-to-many relationship to Territory objects.
    * Territory has a many-to-many relationship back to Employee objects.  This is the inverse side of the relationship.
    * Region has a one-to-many relationship to Territory; the relationship is defined in the Territory HBM.

  - Northwind.Tests
    * Northwind.Core/RegionTests.cs, TerritoryTests.cs, and EmployeeTests.cs test the domain model of the new classes.
    * Northwind.Data/EmployeeDaoTests.cs and TerritoryDaoTests.cs test the many-to-many relationships in the database along with the many-to-one from Territory to Region.
